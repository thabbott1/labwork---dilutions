# labwork---dilutions
A spreadsheet example of practical methods for calculating dilutions. The spreadsheet was created with LibreOffice Calc. The .xls/.xlsx version was saved from Calc, and calculations should work similarly, but graphics may not work as in Calc. I will fix the .xls/.xlsx versions periodically when I access a Windows machine.
